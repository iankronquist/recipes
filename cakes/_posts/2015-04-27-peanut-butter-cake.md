Ingredients:
------------

* 2 cups spelt, white, or Bob’s gf flour (265g)
* 3/4 tsp baking soda
* 3/4 tsp salt
* 1 cup granulated sugar of choice OR xylitol (200g)
* 1/4 cup plus 2 tbsp yogurt (such as So Delicious coconutmilk yogurt) (90g)
* 1 cup plus 2 tbsp water (270g)
* 1/4 cup plus 2 tbsp peanut butter or almond butter, OR allergy-friendly alternative (90g)
* 1 tbsp pure vanilla extract (15g)

Directions:
-----------

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F, grease a 14-in baking pan, and set aside. 
2. In a large bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, salt, and sweetener, and stir very well. Set aside. 
3. If your nut butter is not stir-able, gently heat it until stir-able. 
4. In a new bowl, whisk together the nut butter, yogurt, water, and vanilla. 
5. Pour wet into dry and stir until just combined (don’t over-mix), then pour into the greased pan. 
6. Bake 25 minutes or until batter has risen and a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out mostly clean. If you can wait, I highly recommend not taking a taste until the next day… this cake is much sweeter after sitting for a day. Trust me!
