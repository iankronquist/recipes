Directions:
-----------

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F, and grease an 8-in square or round pan. (Or double the recipe for a double-layer cake.) Set aside. 
2. In a large bowl, combine the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, salt, optional chips, and sweetener, and stir very well. 
3. In a separate bowl, whisk together all remaining ingredients. 
4. Pour wet into dry and stir until just combined (don’t over-mix), then pour into the greased pan. 
5. Bake 25 minutes or until batter has risen and a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. 
6. Put in the fridge for at least 30 minutes.
