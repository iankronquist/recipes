Ingredients:
------------

* 1 1/2 cups sorghum flour (180g) (spelt or white flour also work)
* 1 tsp baking powder
* 1/2 tsp baking soda
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 2 tsp ground cinnamon
* 1/2 cup sugar or xylitol (100g)
* 1/2 cup milk of choice (120g), plus up to 1/4 cup more if needed
* 1 tsp white or apple cider vinegar (5g)
* 1/2 cup pumpkin puree (120g)
* 1/4 cup vegetable or melted coconut oil (40g)
* 1 1/2 cup water (360g)
* 1/2 cup brown sugar (80g)

Directions:
-----------

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. 
2. In a large mixing bowl, stir together the first six ingredient (down to the milk)
3. In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, vinegar, pumpkin, and oil. 
4. In a large cup, mix the brown sugar into the water. 
5. Combine the contents of the two bowls (not the cup), and stir to form a batter. You want a cake-batter texture, so add a little extra milk of choice if the dough is too dry. (Katie added 1/4 cup extra when testing this recipe with sorghum flour.) 
6. Pour the batter into an 8-inch square pan. 
7. Now pour the brown sugar water evenly on top, but do not stir!
8. Place the pan in the middle of the oven and bake 34 minutes. The top will look like cakeâ€¦ but if you reach your fork down, there will be a layer of sweet pumpkin pudding on the bottom! 

Top with some homemade whipped cream for even more yumminess!
