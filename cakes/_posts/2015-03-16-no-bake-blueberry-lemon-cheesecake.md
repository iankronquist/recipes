Ingredients:
------------

##Crust
1/2 cup pitted dates
1/2 cup almonds
pinch of salt

##Filling
3/4 cup cashew nuts, soaked in water overnight then drained (alternatively, if you're in a hurry, you can soak them in very hot watter for 1 hour)
2 tbsp lemon juice
Zest from 1 small lemon
3 tbsp coconut oil, melted
1/3 cup coconut milk (full fat)
1-3 tbsp maple syrup (to taste)
1/4 cup (25 g) fresh or frozen blueberries

Directions:
-----------

1. Soak the dates in warm water for 15 minutes then drain. Put almonds in a food processor and pulse until finely chopped. Add the dates and salt and pulse until a paste forms.
2. Press mixture into a 5-inch springform pan (if you don't have a springform pan, use a pie tin or a regular cake pan covered with parchment paper). Put the pan in the freezer while you prepare the filling.
3. Put all ingredients for the filling in a blender and mix until mixture is as smooth as possible. Pour the filling into the crust, cover with plastic wrap and freeze for at least 4 hours.
4. Remove the cake from the pan and leave to thaw in room temperature for about 10-15 minutes before cutting. Top with fresh whipped cream or blueberries for extra yumminess
