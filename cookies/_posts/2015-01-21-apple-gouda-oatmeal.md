Directions:
-----------

1. Preheat the oven to 375Â°F. 
2. Whisk the olive oil and egg together in a glass measuring cup until completely combined. 
3. Whisk in the vanilla.
4. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, brown sugar, ginger, baking powder, salt, and oats. 
5. Peel and core the apple. 
6. Use the coarse side of a grater to grate it directly into the flour. (You should have 1 1/2 to 2 cups of shredded apple.) 
7. Stir in the apple and the chopped Gouda.
8. Add the liquids from the measuring cup and stir just until everything is moistened. 
9. The dough will be loose and clumpy. 
10. Drop in large spoonfuls on an ungreased baking sheet. 
11. Bake for 17 minutes, or until the cookies are golden. They will be very soft still. Let them cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes before removing to cooling racks to cool completely.
