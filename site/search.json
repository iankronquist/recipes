Whisk sugar, flour, cinnamon, and allspice in a large bowl.  Fold in peaches and blueberries with a wooden spoon or spatula, until coated with sugary-floury-mix  Roll out the pie crust: On a floured work surface, roll out one of the balls of chilled dough (keep the other one in the refrigerator).   Turn the dough about a quarter turn after every few rolls until you have a circle 12 inches in diameter.   Carefully place the dough into a 9x2 inch pie dish. Tuck it in with your fingers, making sure it is smooth.   With a small and sharp knife, trim the extra overhang of crust and discard. Crimp the edges with your fingers, if desired.  Fill the pie crust with prepared fruit filling.   Cut the butter into tiny pieces and randomly place on top of the filling. Set aside.  Make the lattice crust: Remove the other ball of chilled dough from the refrigerator.   Roll the dough out, 12 inches diameter.   Using a pastry wheel, sharp knife, or pizza cutter, cut 12 strips about 1 inch wide.   Carefully thread the strips over and under one another, pulling back strips as necessary to weave.   Using a small and sharp knife, trim the extra overhang and clamp down the edges of the dough with your fingers.  Brush the lattice top with the beaten egg. A very thin coating - you don’t want scrambled eggs on top of your dough. Mix the remaining 1 Tablespoon of granulated sugar with the 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon. Sprinkle over crust.  Place the pie onto a large baking sheet and bake for 20 minutes.   Keeping the pie in the oven, turn the temperature down to 375F and bake for an additional 25-30 minutes. If the top of your pie is getting too brown, cover loosely with aluminum foil or use a pie shield for the edges.  Enjoy!Allow the pie to cool for 4 full hours at room temperature before serving. It’s a great pie to make 1 day in advance, since it is so juicy - the filling will have time to “set” overnight."

Texture will just be less fudge-like. Or see note below for a possible substitution.) (20g) Directions:  If peanut butter is not stir-able, gently heat until you are able to easily stir it.   Either combine all ingredients in a small blender until completely smooth, OR mash the banana and stir together ingredients very patiently by hand until completely smooth.   Scoop into a small plastic container OR parchment-lined glass container OR candy molds OR mini cupcake liners. (You have options!)   Freeze until firm. Due to the melty nature of coconut, this fudge is best stored in the freezer. "
