  <li>3/4 cup flour</li>
  <li>1/4 cup firmly packed brown sugar</li>

  <li>Whisk in the vanilla.</li>
  <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, brown sugar, ginger, baking powder, salt, and oats. </li>
  <li>Peel and core the apple. </li>
  <li>Use the coarse side of a grater to grate it directly into the flour. (You should have 1 1/2 to 2 cups of shredded apple.) </li>
  <li>Stir in the apple and the chopped Gouda.</li>
  <li>Add the liquids from the measuring cup and stir just until everything is moistened. </li>
  <li>The dough will be loose and clumpy. </li>
  <li>Drop in large spoonfuls on an ungreased baking sheet. </li>
  <li>Bake for 17 minutes, or until the cookies are golden. They will be very soft still. Let them cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes before removing to cooling racks to cool completely.</li>
