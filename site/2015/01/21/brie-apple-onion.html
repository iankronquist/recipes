It may sound weird, but it’s soooooo good</p>

<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
  <li>5 tablespoons butter (That’s how you know it’s gonna be good)</li>
  <li>1 onion, sliced</li>
  <li>1 apple, sliced (we like honeycrisp)</li>
  <li>1 puff pastry sheet, thawed (you can get them at the store near the pie crusts or make your own)</li>
  <li>1 8oz round brie</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Preheat oven to 400*</li>
  <li>Melt buter in a skillet over medium heat</li>
  <li>Add onions and apple, and cook until tender and brown</li>
  <li>Let cool (about 15-20 minutes)</li>
  <li>Unfold pastry on cookie sheet.</li>
  <li>Set brie in the center, and top with apple-onion mixture</li>
  <li>Brush pastry edges with water (we use our fingers), and fold pastry over filling, pinching together at the top. You can make some pretty patterns or shapes if you’d like.</li>
  <li>Pour lightly beaten egg or butter over top to “seal” pastry</li>
  <li>Bake until golden brown, about 25-30 minutes.</li>
</ol>
