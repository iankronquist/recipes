title: Jody’s Awesome Meringue Cake
time: 60 minutes
---


Notes:
------

This delicious recipe will satiate any sweet tooth. It makes a massive
quadruple layer whipped creme and meringue cake the size of a dinner plate, so
I recommend that you make a half or even a quarter recipe. For the most
exquisite results, top the cake with chocolate covered strawberries. The extra
egg yolks can be used in a creme-brulee or a souffle if you're up to the task,
but if you aren't feeling like serving a multi course French themed dessert I
would recommend just fixing some French toast or feeding the yolks to your dog.  

Ingredients:
------------

* 12 egg whites
* 3/4tsp salt
* 3/4 tsp cream of tartar
* 6 tsp vanilla
* 41/2 cups sugar
* Dark chocolate (you can buy Hershey chocolate chips and follow the package
  for melting instructions)
* whipping cream
* fresh fruit (raspberries, strawberries, blueberries, etc)

Directions:
-----------

1. Preheat oven to 300 degrees
2. Separate 12 eggs. Beat egg whites with salt, cream of tartar, and vanilla
   using an electric mixer until stiff peaks form.
3. Gradually beat in the sugar, a tbsp
   at a time, until glossy and thick peaks are left, when the beaters are
   lifted out.
4. Spread on parchment (you can use clean brown paper bags) 1” thick making
   4 rounds.
5. Bake meringues at 300 degrees Fahrenheit for 25-35 minutes or until crisp
   and lightly brown on top.
6. Let cool and carefully remove from parchment. 
7. To assemble the cake, layer meringue with drizzled melted dark chocolate,
fruit, and whipping cream in 4 repeating layers. Top has drizzled chocolate and
fruit only
