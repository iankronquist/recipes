Directions:
-----------

1. Whisk milk of choice, cocoa, and salt in a small saucepan. 
2. Bring to boil. Once it boils, lower to LOW and add all of the chocolate. 
3. Stir until the chocolate melts and is completely creamy, with no lumps (about 2-3 minutes). 
4. Turn off the heat and stir in the vanilla extract or amaretto. 
5. Transfer to a fondue pot or serving dish. Serve with sliced fruit, graham crackers, or anything you think would taste better with a coating of chocolate. (Read: everything!)
