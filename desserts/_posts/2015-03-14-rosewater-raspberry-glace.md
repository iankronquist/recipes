Ingredients:
------------

* 1¼ cup icing sugar
* 3 tablespoons of raspberry juice
* 1/16th of a teaspoon rosewater

<br>

Directions:
-----------

1. Stir the juice into the sugar until combined.
2. Add the rosewater. Only a teensy amount (it is a very powerful flavour – I used about 1/16th of a teaspoon!)
3. Thin out with more juice or thicken with more icing sugar as needed. When making your cupcakes, spoon only a small amount (2 tablespoons) into the cupcake liner. This will leave room for the icing.
4. Once the cupcakes cool, spoon the icing on top of the cupcakes and spread to the edges of the cupcake liner. Top with a rose petal or sugar flower.
