Ingredients:
------------

* 1/2 cup mashed ripe avocado 
* 6 tbsp coconut butter, melted (I just used regular butter)
* 2 tbsp pure maple syrup or raw agave or honey
* 1 tsp pure vanilla extract 
* tiny pinch salt
* stevia to taste, OR 1 additional tbsp both pure maple syrup and coconut butter (We didn't add it)

Directions:
-----------
     
1. If you have a Magic Bullet, blend all ingredients together until smooth. If you only have a bigger blender, you might wish to double the recipe for smoother blending. You can blend by hand if you absolutely must, but be sure to get the mixture completely smooth. 
2. Spread into a small plastic container and freeze until set (at least 3 hours). At this time, you can either scoop into balls with a mini cookie scoop or you can simply cut into fudge. 
3. If you want to coat them in chocolate (and why wouldnâ€™t you?!), mix together equal parts cocoa powder, virgin coconut oil (or milk), and pure maple syrup until a thin sauce forms. Dip in the fudge balls, then immediately set back in the freezer to harden. 
4. Leftovers should be stored in the fridge or freezer for up to three days.
