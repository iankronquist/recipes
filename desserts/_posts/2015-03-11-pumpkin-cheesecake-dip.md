Ingredients:
------------


* 1 can pumpkin (15oz)
* 1 container cream cheese-style spread
* 2 tsp cinnamon (more if desired)
* 3/4 tsp pumpkin pie spice
* 1 1/2 tsp pure vanilla extract
* sweetener of choice to taste (Amount will depend on whether youâ€™re making this as a dip or a spread. Use up to 1/3 cup for a dip, but you might not even need a tablespoon of sugar or a packet of stevia for a spread. Note that liquid sweeteners will yield a much thinner dip, so either powdered sugar or nunaturals stevia are recommended.)

Directions:
-----------

1. Combine all ingredients and mix very well. (A food processor is best, but this can be done by hand with a lot of stirring). 
2. Serve as a dip, with graham crackers or gingersnaps or fresh fruit. Or use as a festive cream-cheese spread on bagels, toast or pancakes. This will keep in the refrigerator 4-5 days.
