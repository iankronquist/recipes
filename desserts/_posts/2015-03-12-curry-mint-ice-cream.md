Ingredients:
------------

* 2 cups whipping cream
* 1 cup whole milk
* 1/2 cup fresh mint leaves, torn
* 1/2 teaspoon coriander powder
* 1/2 teaspoon sweet paprika

Directions:
-----------

1. In a medium pot, combine the cream, milk, mint, coriander, paprika, turmeric and salt. 
2. Bring to a boil, and then turn off the heat, cover with a lid and let infuse for 10 minutes.
3. Whisk the sugar and egg yolks until pale and thick. 
4. Slowly begin to add the hot cream mixture while whisking constantly to temper the eggs. If the cream is added too quickly, the eggs will scramble. 
5. Pour the mixture back into the pot and cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until it is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. 
6. Pour into a clean bowl and refrigerate for several hours, until it is cold.
7. Stir in the chocolate chips, then put in ice cream maker for 20-30 minutes. 
8. Transfer the ice cream to a freezer-proof container and store in the freezer.
