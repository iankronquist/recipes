1. Put the nut butter and coconut oil in the food processor and mix for 1 minute or so. 
2. Add chocolate powder, then put in the rest of the ingredients (apart from the cherries) and whizz for a few minutes until totally gooey. 
3. Throw in the cherries and mix with a spoon.
4. Scoop out the mixture with a spatula into a coconut oil-greased 24cm baking tin, then put it in the freezer for 30 minutes until firmly set.
5. Cut the fudge into bite-size bites with a sharp knife, then pop them back in the fridge. It will keep in the fridge for two weeks.
