Directions:

Cupcakes

1. Preheat oven to 350°F. Line the cupcake tins with paper liners.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, ½ of the chai spice mixture and salt. Set aside.
3. In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat combine water and sugar. 
4. Bring to a simmer and stir until all the sugar dissolves (about 5-8 minutes). 
5. Remove from heat and add butter. Stir until melted & allow to cool. 
6. Whisk in the vegetable oil and vanilla. 
7. Add dry ingredients to wet ingredients (whichever bowl is bigger, really) and mix until smooth. 
8. Divide the batter evenly between cupcake liners, approximately 2/3 full. 
9. Place in the oven and bake for 18-20 minutes for full-size cupcakes, about 12-15 minutes for mini cupcakes, or until toothpick is inserted in the centre and comes out clean. Allow to cool completely.

Chai Buttercream

1. Cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy (beat really fast with a mixer), about 3-5 minutes. 
2. Add the powdered sugar, 1 cup at a time, mixing thoroughly after each addition. Increase speed to medium, add the vanilla, chai spice & milk until well incorporated (we did not end up needing the milk. Your mileage may vary).
3. Decorate with a pastry bag fitted with decorative tip-any kind you choose (or use a spoon). Sprinkle with cinnamon.
