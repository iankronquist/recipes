Ingredients:
------------

* 1 large, ripe avocado (it should be soft)
* 2 cups plain yogurt of choice (such as Wholesoy) (440g)
* 1/2 cup milk of choice (120g)
* 1/2 tsp pure vanilla extract (2g)
* 1/8 tsp salt
* pinch pure stevia extract, or 3-4 tbsp sugar of choice (Amount will depend on the sweetness of your yogurt, and you may need more if you’re using an unsweetened yogurt. You want the non-frozen mixture to taste a little too sweet for your liking, as it is less sweet once frozen.)

Directions:
-----------
1. Avocado frozen yogurt recipe: Scrape out the flesh of the avocado and discard the peel and pit. 
2. Blend all ingredients until completely smooth, in a blender, food processor, or Vita-Mix. 
3. If you have an ice cream maker, transfer mixture to the machine and churn according to manufacturer’s directions. 
4. From Katie: My Cuisinart took just 10 minutes. Eat immediately as soft-serve, or freeze in an airtight container for a half hour if you want a firmer texture. 
5. If you don’t have an ice cream machine (as we don't), you can simply transfer the blended mixture to an airtight container, freeze, and stir every  half hour for 2-3 hours. The texture won’t be quite as creamy, but it still works!
