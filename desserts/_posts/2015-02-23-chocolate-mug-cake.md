Ingredients:
------------

* 1 tbsp plus 2 tsp cocoa powder
* 3 tbsp spelt flour (or white, or Arrowhead Mills gf)
* 1/8 tsp salt
* 2 tsp sugar or evaporated cane juice (edit: xylitol works as well)
* 1/4 tsp baking powder
* pinch uncut stevia OR 1 more tbsp sugar
* 2-3 tsp coconut oil or vegetable oil (Edit: many commenters have said it still tastes good if you sub applesauce or mashed banana. I can't personally vouch for that substitution.)
* 3 tablespoons milk of choice (I used almond milk)
* 1/2 tsp pure vanilla extract

<br>

Directions:
-----------

1. Combine dry ingredients and mix well. 
2. Add liquid, stir, then transfer to a little dish, ramekin, or even a coffee mug. 
3. Either microwave 30-40 seconds OR cook in a 350F oven for about 14 minutes. 
4. If you donâ€™t want to eat it straight out of the dish, be sure to spray your dish first (and then wait for it to cool before trying to remove it).

"Optional" Chocolate Frosting
-----------------------------

* 1/4 cup peanut butter or allergy-friendly alternative
* 4-8 tsp pure maple syrup 
* 2 tbsp cocoa powder
* 4 tsp milk of choice, or more for thinner frosting
* 3/4 tsp pure vanilla extract
* optional: handful of chocolate chips (the "pieces")

1. Blend everything (including chips, if using) in a small food processor or Magic Bullet. If you have a bigger processor, it might be best to double the recipe so everything blends more smoothly. Best to store uneaten frosting covered in the fridge.
