Ingredients:
------------

* 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar
* 1/4 cup water
* 1/4 cup heavy cream
* 12 ounces (3 sticks) unsalted butter, softened
* 4 large egg whites, room temperature
* 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

Directions:
-----------

1. Bring 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar and the water to a boil in a medium saucepan. 
2. Cook, undisturbed, until caramel is dark amber. 
3. Remove from heat, and slowly add cream, stirring with a wooden spoon until smooth. Let cool.
4. Beat butter with a mixer (hand mixer or kitchen-aid) on medium speed until pale and fluffy, about 3 minutes.
5. Place whites and remaining 1/2 cup sugar in a heatproof bowl set over a pot of simmering water. 
6. Whisk until sugar dissolves and mixture is hot. 
7. Mix on medium speed for 5 minutes. Increase speed to medium-high, and whisk until stiff, glossy peaks form, about 6 minutes. 
8. Reduce speed to medium, and add beaten butter, cup at a time, whisking well after each addition. Whisk in vanilla.
9. Switch to using a wooden spoon, add caramel, and beat until smooth, 3 to 5 minutes.
