1. Combin ingredients in a medium sized pot on the stovetop, whisking over medium high heat until everything is blended together.
2. Cool for 20 minutes in the freezer, then pour directly into molds (or just leave in the bowl)
3. You will want these to freeze overnight for maximum popsicle-ness! Feel free to play around with the condensed milk amount to adjust to your ideal level of sweetness.
