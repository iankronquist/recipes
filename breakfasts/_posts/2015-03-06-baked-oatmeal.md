Directions:
-----------

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. 
2. Combine all ingredients. 
3. Pour into a small baking pan, loaf pan, or 1-cup ramekin (or greased mini-cupcake tin)
4. Cook for 15-20 minutes, or more until it’s firm. i
5. Finally, set your oven to “high broil” for 3 more minutes (or simply just bake longer, but broiling gives it a nice crust). 
Don’t forget to spray your ramekins first, if you want your cakes to pop out!
