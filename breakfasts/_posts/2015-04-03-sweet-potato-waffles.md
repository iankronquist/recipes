Ingredients:
------------

* 2 small sweet potatoes, roasted and cooled
* 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
* 2 teaspoons baking powder
* 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice
* 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg

* 1/4 cup maple syrup
* 1 1/4 cup buttermilk

Directions:
-----------

1. To roast the potatoes, place a rack in the upper third of the oven and preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Wrap whole, unpeeled sweet potatoes in foil, place on a rimmed baking sheet and allow to bake until a fork inserted in the potato meets no resistance. Depending on the size of your potatoes, this could take 30 minutes or so. Remove from the oven and allow to rest until cool enough to handle. Peel the potatoes, discard the peel, and mash well with a fork. Measure 1 cup of potatoes for the waffles.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and spices. Set aside.
3. In another medium bowl beat eggs and sugar, then add in vanilla
4. Whisk in the melted butter, maple syrup, and buttermilk. Stir to combine.
5. Add the wet ingredients all at once to the dry ingredients. Stir well to combine thoroughly. Allow to rest while the waffle iron heats.
6. Spray waffle iron if it isn't already nonstick. Add waffle batter and cook according to your specific waffle iron.
7. Serve warm with pure maple syrup. These waffles also freeze very well once baked.
