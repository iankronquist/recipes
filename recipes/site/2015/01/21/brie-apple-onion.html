It may sound weird, but it's soooooo good

Ingredients
-----------

* 5 tablespoons butter (That's how you know it's gonna be good)
* 1 onion, sliced
* 1 apple, sliced (we like honeycrisp)
* 1 puff pastry sheet, thawed (you can get them at the store near the pie crusts or make your own)
* 1 8oz round brie

0. Preheat oven to 400*
1. Melt buter in a skillet over medium heat
2. Add onions and apple, and cook until tender and brown
3. Let cool (about 15-20 minutes)
4. Unfold pastry on cookie sheet.
5. Set brie in the center, and top with apple-onion mixture
6. Brush pastry edges with water (we use our fingers), and fold pastry over filling, pinching together at the top. You can make some pretty patterns or shapes if you'd like.
7. Pour lightly beaten egg or butter over top to "seal" pastry
8. Bake until golden brown, about 25-30 minutes.
