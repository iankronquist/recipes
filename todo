Things I want this site to say or do:
* Be easy to navigate
* Be minimal in design, not visually overwhelming
* Be intuitive -- user should know where to look for something
* Be legible
* Be artistic -- "I've never seen a food blog like that before"
* Be 'original' -- no watercolor splashes or full page background images
* Be personal -- I want to try to include more about myself, so that people can relate to me (but don't necessarily want it to be a blog?)
* Perhaps try hand at graphic design with foods
