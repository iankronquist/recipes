Ingredients:
------------

* 3/4 cup apple juice
* 1/2 cup pomegranate juice
* Optional: 2 inch long orange rind strip
* 1 cinnamon stick, or 2 tsp ground cinnamon
* 2 pears, peeled, halved, and cored
* 1 (5.3 oz) yogurt

Directions:
-----------

1. In a small pan over medium-high heat, bring apple juice, pomagranate juice, orange rind and cinnamon stick to a boil.
2. Place pears face down in the pan. Lower heat and simmer gently until a knife inserted into the pears meets no resistance, about 10-20 minutes, spooning the sauce over the pears as they cook.
3. Once the pears are tender, remove from heat and let cool.
4. Over medium-low heat, reduce the remaining poaching liquid to a glaze, about 7 to 8 minutes. Pour over pears. Refrigerate until ready to serve.
5. To serve, place 1/2 pear on each dish and top with a dollop of yogurt over each.
