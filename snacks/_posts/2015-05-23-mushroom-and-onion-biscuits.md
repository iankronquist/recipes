title: Caramelized Mushroom and Onion Biscuits
time: 45 minutes
---


Notes:
------

Makes 12 biscuits. I substituted rice vinegar for balsamic vinegar and skipped
the shortening in favor of more butter. I used a red onion which caramelized an
odd green color in the oven — next time I'll use a yellow onion as the recipe
recommends.

Ingredients:
------------
* ½ pound cremini mushrooms, sliced
* 1 small yellow onion, sliced
* 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
* ½ cup unsalted butter, cold and cut into cubes
* ¼ cup vegetable shortening, cold and cut into cubes. Alternately just use
  more butter.
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme (optional)
* Salt and coarse ground black pepper to taste for seasoning the mushrooms
* 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar or balsamic vinegar reduction. I substituted
  rice vinegar to great effect.
* ¾ teaspoon salt
* 3 cups all-purpose flour
* 2 tablespoons sugar
* 3 teaspoons baking powder
* ½ teaspoon baking soda
* 1 egg, beaten
* ¾ cup cold buttermilk
* 1 egg beaten for egg wash (optional)

Directions:
-----------
* Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil and 1 tablespoon of butter in a medium saute
  pan over medium heat.
* Add mushrooms and allow to cook until tender and golden
  brown, stirring occasionally. Season with salt and pepper and remove
  from the pan.
* Add 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1 tablespoon butter in the same
  pan. Add onions and cook down until tender and browned, stirring
  occasionally.
 
* Remove from heat, add the mushrooms back to the pan along with
  thyme, balsamic vinegar, salt and pepper.  Set aside to cool.

* In a mixing bowl, sift together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and
 salt. Cut in shortening and butter until mixture resembles coarse meal.
* In another bowl, combine egg and milk and beat lightly with a fork.
* Add to flour mixture all at once, stirring enough to make a soft dough.
* Add the cooled
  mushroom and onion mixture and blend together.
* Flour a cutting board and knead the dough. Pat it out into a 1 inch thick
  slab.
* Slice 6-8 scones like a pie.
* Place on a baking sheet and bake at 425 degrees Fahrenheit for 12-15 minutes.
