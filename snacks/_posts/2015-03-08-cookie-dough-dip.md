Ingredients:
------------

* 1 1/2 cups chickpeas or white beans (1 can, drained) (250g after draining)
* 1/8 tsp salt
* 1 tbsp vanilla
* 1/4 cup nut butter of choice (You can get away with using only 3 tbsp. If you use peanut butter, some people say it has a slight "pb cookie dough" taste, so you can sub oil if you don't want that.)
* 2/3 cup brown sugar
* 1/3 cup chocolate chips (see link below, for sugar-free option)
* 2 tbsp oats
* Milk as necessary

Directions:
-----------

1. Add all ingredients (except for chocolate chips) to a good food processor, and process until very smooth. 
2. Mix in the chocolate chips. (Some commenters have had success with a blender, but I did not. Try that at your own risk, and know the results will be better in a high-quality food processor such as a Cuisinart.) If made correctly and blended long enough, this should have the exact texture of real cookie dough!

* I would like to note that I, personally, do not care for this recipe, however my boyfriend enjoyed it quite a bit, so I opted to include it on the site.  Make at your own risk.
