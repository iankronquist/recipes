Directions:

##Buns:

1. Combine 2 cups milk, canola oil, and 1/2 cup sugar in a saucepan. 
2. Stir and heat until very warm but not boiling. 
3. Turn off the heat and allow to cool until mixture is still warm, but not hot--about 30 minutes.
4. Sprinkle yeast over mixture. Add 4 cups of flour and stir to combine. 
5. Mixture will be very sticky. Cover with a towel and set aside for 1 hour.
6. Add 1/2 cup flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Stir till combined.
7. Combine 1/4 cup sugar with cinnamon and whatever other spices you want to use.
8. Lightly flour surface. Press to slightly flatten dough. 
9. Sprinkle a couple tablespoons of the sugar/cinnamon mixture. Then fold the dough over on itself and flatten again so the dough is "plain" again. Repeat the sugaring process two more times.
10. Pinch off ping pong or golf ball-size bunches of dough. With floured hands, quickly roll it into a ball, then turn the edges under themselves slightly. 
11. Place on a lightly greased cookie sheet. Cover and allow to rise in a warm place for at least 30 minutes...an hour-plus is better.
12. Preheat oven to 400F.
13. Mix glaze ingredients and dip buns into it, then place back on cookie sheet.
14. Bake buns for 20 minutes, or until deep golden brown
15. In the meantime, mix the icing ingredients, adding sugar and milk as necessary. 
16. Using a ziploc bag as an icing piper (snip off one corner and fill with icing), and pipe icing on in a criss-cross over the buns.  
17. Once the icing has dried you're all done!
